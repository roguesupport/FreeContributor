## Obtain the FreeContributor source code

## Pull Requests

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the [main repository](https://github.com/tbds/FreeContributor) on GitHub.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/tbds/FreeContributor).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page. 
This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourUSusername/FreeContributor.git
        $ cd FreeContributor

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes. Don't work in the ``master`` branch!

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:

        $ git add modified_files
        $ git commit -m "Super awesome commit"

5. Push your changes to GitHub with:

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the FreeContributor repo and click 'Pull request' to send your changes for review.


## Bad domains 

You can also contribute by running [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) in Advanced mode and/or [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix).

To change to uBlock Advanced-user mode, go to `Click To Open Dashboard` and select the checkbox `I am an advanced user`

Basic mode | Advanced-user mode
:----------:|:------------------:
[Popup user interface](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface) | [A point-and-click firewall which can be configured on a per-site basis](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide)

After reading the [uBlock wiki: Dynamic filtering: quick guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide), start blocking
the bad domanains in the websites you visit. 

**ATTENTION:** make sure that the website works, with the rules you applied in Ublock Origin/uMatrix.

The data is stored in the browser and can be exported to a text file. Go to uBlock dashboard -> My rules and export to file. The same applies to uMatrix.

Finally save the file in `FreeContributor/utils` and run the script `ublock-umatrix-export.sh`. Example:


    $ ./ublock-umatrix-export.sh dnsmasq my-umatrix.rules


This will export only the blocked domains to dnsmasq formart `server=/bad-domain.tld/` to `dnsmasq-umatrix.conf`. Save it at `/etc/dnsmasq.d/`

You can send me this bad domains via pull request. See a sample at `FreeContributor/data/samples`


    $ ./ublock-umatrix-export.sh domains my-umatrix.rules


Add the file `domains` generated by the script.
