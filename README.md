TL:DR `cat domains-{ads,tracking,malware} > /dev/null`

## Intro

More and more people use "adblocker" plugins within their desktop browsers.
FreeContributor is an alternative for "ad blocking extensions" in your browser.

FreeContributor intends to extract domains lists from various sources.
It [blocks ads, malware, trackers at DNS level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL).

## Why

 - [Major sites including New York Times and BBC hit by 'ransomware' malvertising](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/16/major-sites-new-york-times-bbc-ransomware-malvertising)
 - [Adblocking: advertising 'accounts for half of data used to read articles'](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/16/ad-blocking-advertising-half-of-data-used-articles)
 - [The Verge's web sucks](http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/) and [The web is Doom](https://mobiforge.com/research-analysis/the-web-is-doom)

## Why this fork?

This fork has the purpose to create a very simple dns-blacklist generator, so it just downloads all domain lists, merges them and generates a file in the specified format (`/etc/hosts`, `dnsmasq`, `unbound` and `pdnsd`), nothing more.

##### Differences between the original:
 - doesn't need any privileges besides writing access to the output file
 - doesn't install any package on the OS
 - doesn't modifies any system files
 - doesn't trigger the init-system to restart the dns server

## What the script does?

 - Download domain lists from various sources and generate a blacklist in data formats for `/etc/hosts`, `dnsmasq`, `unbound` and `pdnsd`.

## Benefits and Features

 - Low CPU and RAM usage.
 - **Speeds up your Internet** use since the local file is checked first, before send a DNS request.
 - **Data savings** since the ad content is never downloaded.
 - Stops ad tracking and protect your privacy.
 - Blocks spyware and malware. That increases the safety of your networking experience.
 - Not just for browsers, it blocks ads and malware across the entire operative system.


## Requirements

 - [GNU bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html)
 - [GNU coreutils(grep, sed)](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils)
 - [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/)


## Installation and Usage

```sh

git clone https://github.com/gcarq/FreeContributor
cd FreeContributor

```

```sh

    USAGE: 

      $ ./FreeContributor.sh [-f format]  [-o out] [-t target]

       -f format: specify an output format:

          none        Extract domains only
          hosts       Use hosts format
          dnsmasq     dnsmasq as DNS resolver
          unbound     unbound as DNS resolver
          pdnsd       pdnsd as DNS resolver

       -o out: specify an output file

       -t target: specify the target
    
          default: 0.0.0.0
                   ::
                   NXDOMAIN
                   custom (e.g. 192.168.1.20)

       -help         Show this help


    EXAMPLES:

      $ ./FreeContributor.sh -f hosts -t 0.0.0.0 -o blacklist.txt

      $ ./FreeContributor.sh -f dnsmasq -t NXDOMAIN -o blacklist.txt

```

Inspired by [jmdugan's blocklists project](https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists), FreeContributor project comes with a 
[catalog of corporation domain names](https://github.com/tbds/FreeContributor/tree/master/data) that people may want to block. 

FreeContributor also downloads external files, each has its own license, detailed in the list below.

    +----+      +--------------------+      +------------------------------------------+



## Hosts vs DNS resolver

The hosts blocking method can not use wildcards (*) and and therefore someone must keep track 
of each subdomain that should be blocked. Some DNS caching servers can block the domain and
subdomains with just one rule. For example `/etc/hosts`

    127.0.0.1 example.tld
    0.0.0.0 example.tld


Will redirect `example.tld` to the localhost, but not `ads.example.tld`. With a dns caching server,
such as Dnsmasq, for example `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`

    address=/example.tld/127.0.0.1
    address=/example.tld/0.0.0.0
    server=/example.tld/


Will redirect example.tld and all subdomains to 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0. Better yet, it can 
return NXDOMAIN.
